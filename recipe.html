        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven.
                Set your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour an 8-inch round cake pan (or line it with parchment
                paper) so the cake won’t stick.</li>
            <li>Cream the butter and sugar.
                In a large mixing bowl, beat together ½ cup softened butter and 1 cup sugar until the mixture becomes
                light and fluffy. This helps incorporate air, giving your cake a soft texture.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs and vanilla.
                Crack in 2 large eggs, adding them one at a time. Beat well after each egg so they blend smoothly. Stir
                in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract for flavor.</li>
            <li>Prepare the dry ingredients.
                In a separate bowl, mix together 1 ½ cups of all-purpose flour and 1 ¾ teaspoons of baking powder. This
                ensures the baking powder is evenly distributed throughout the flour.</li>
            <li>Combine wet and dry mixtures.
                Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter-sugar mixture. Alternate between adding the flour
                mixture and ½ cup milk, mixing gently each time until everything is combined into a smooth batter.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the pan.
                Transfer the batter to your prepared cake pan, spreading it out evenly with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Bake the cake.
                Place the pan in the oven and bake for 30–40 minutes. The cake is ready when a toothpick or knife
                inserted in the center comes out clean. </li>
            <li>Cool the cake.
                Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then turn it out onto a
                wire rack to cool completely before slicing or frosting.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2><u>Helpful Tip</u></h2>
        <p>For an extra moist cake, you can substitute half of the milk with sour cream or yogurt. This adds a slight
            tanginess and enhances the cake's texture.</p>
        <p>
            <em> Storage tips:</em> Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 2–3 days, or refrigerate for
            up to a week.
            <i> Optional variations:</i> Optional variations: You can add chocolate chips, a layer of jam, or frost with
            buttercream for extra flavor.
